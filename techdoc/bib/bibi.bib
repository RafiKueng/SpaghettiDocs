  abstract = {We introduce and implement two novel ideas for modeling lensed quasars.
	The first is to require different lenses to agree about H0. This
	means that some models for one lens can be ruled out by data on a
	different lens. We explain using two worked examples. One example
	models 1115+080 and 1608+656 (time-delay quadruple systems) and 1933+503
	(a prospective time-delay system) all together, yielding time-delay
	predictions for the third lens and a 90\% confidence estimate of H-10=14.6+9.4-1.7
	Gyr (H0=67+9-26 km s-1 Mpc-1) assuming ΩM=0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7. The other
	example models the time-delay doubles 1520+530, 1600+434, 1830-211,
	and 2149-275, which gives H-10=14.5+3.3-1.5 Gyr (H0=67+8-13 km s-1
	Mpc-1). Our second idea is to write the modeling software as a highly
	interactive Java applet, which can be used both for coarse-grained
	results inside a browser and for fine-grained results on a workstation.
	Several obstacles come up in trying to implement a numerically intensive
	method thus, but we overcome them.},
